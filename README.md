# Web-based Synthesizer

This project is a feature-rich, web-based synthesizer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It utilizes the Web Audio API to create a powerful and flexible sound synthesis engine right in your browser.

## Features

- 3 Oscillators with adjustable waveform, frequency, gain, and detune
- FM Synthesis with two FM oscillators
- Low-Pass Filter with adjustable cutoff and resonance
- LFO (Low Frequency Oscillator) with rate and depth controls
- Meta LFO for modulating the main LFO
- Distortion effect with multiple distortion types
- Pre and Post distortion filters
- Real-time waveform visualizations for all oscillators
- LFO visualization
- Multiple preset sounds
- Record and download functionality

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge recommended).
3. Click the "Play" button to start the audio context.
4. Experiment with different presets or adjust the controls to create your own sounds.

## Usage

- Use the tabs to navigate between different sections of the synthesizer.
- Adjust sliders and dropdowns to modify the sound.
- The "Play" button toggles audio on and off.
- The "Record" button allows you to record your creation and download it as a WAV file.

## Presets

The synthesizer comes with several built-in presets:

- Wobble Bass
- Fat Sub
- Metallic
- Liquid Bass
- Screaming Lead
- Atmospheric Pad
- Harsh Noise
- Deep Drone
- Crystal Bells

Feel free to use these as starting points for your own sound design.

## Browser Compatibility

This synthesizer uses modern web technologies and is best experienced in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge.
